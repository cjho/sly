MooTools Slick Selector Engine
==============================

A new standalone selector engine that is totally slick!
-------------------------------------------------------

### Create your own custom pseudo-classes!
Ever want to make your own `:my-widget(rocks)` pseudoclass? Now you can!

### Use your own custom getAttribute code!
EG: Use MooTool's Element.get method or jQuery's $.attr

### Use your own parser!
Want to support XPATH selectors? JSONPath selectors? Pre-cached JS Object selctors? Just swap out the default parser and make your own.

### Use the parser by itself!
Want to integrate a CSS3 Selector parser into your own app somehow? Use the slick selector CSS3 parser by itself and get a JS Object representation of your selector.
